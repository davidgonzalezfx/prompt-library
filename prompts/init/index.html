<p>What to add:</p>
<ol>
<li>Commands that will be commonly used, such as how to build, lint, and run tests. Include the necessary commands to develop in this codebase, such as how to run a single test.</li>
<li>High-level code architecture and structure so that future instances can be productive more quickly. Focus on the “big picture” architecture that requires reading multiple files to understand.</li>
</ol>
<p>Usage notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid listing every component or file structure that can be easily discovered.</li>
<li>Don’t include generic development practices.</li>
<li>If there are Cursor rules (in .cursor/rules/ or .cursorrules) or Copilot rules (in .github/copilot-instructions.md), or claude (in .claude/ or claude.md), make sure to include the important parts</li>
<li>If there is a README.md, make sure to include the important parts.</li>
<li>Do not make up information such as “Common Development Tasks”, “Tips for Development”, “Support and Documentation” unless this is expressly included in other files that you read.</li>
